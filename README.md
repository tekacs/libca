# libca

A full-featured coding (or... computer?) agent as a library.

Written in Rust for use from Rust, TypeScript, Python and... more with equivalent ease.

## Status

ðŸš§ **Coming Soon** - Watch this space!

The library is mostly built out but not yet pushed to this repository. I'll be pushing the code in the next few weeks.

## Background

This project emerged from work on improving navigator mode in Aider (see [PR #3781](https://github.com/Aider-AI/aider/pull/3781)), which introduced a tool-using AI coding assistant mode similar to Claude Code. The goal with libca is to create a robust, library-first solution in Rust.

## Coming Soon
